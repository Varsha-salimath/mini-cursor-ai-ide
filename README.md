# Mini Cursor AI IDE 🎨💻
Mini Cursor AI IDE — an AI-powered playground that transforms your prompts into runnable apps with live preview and token tracking
A lightweight **AI-powered IDE** built with Node.js, Express, Gemini AI, and Langfuse.  
Ask it to **build anything** (games, dashboards, visual demos) → it generates runnable files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `main.js`) that you can preview instantly.
